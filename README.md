### Business Problem
SyriaTel, a tele-communications company in the Middle East has brought to our attention(Anonymous Analysts) the upward rate in which its clients are stopping usage of their product. The are looking to get ahead of the customer churn as it is easier to retain and get a return client than it is to onboard a new client.The company therefore wants to take pro-active measures to identify those likely to churn and retain them while improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss.

### Data Understanding
The dataset includes various features related to customer demographics, account information, and service usage. The key features include:

* State: The state where the customer reFor this KNN model, we can deduce that:
* High Recall for Non-Churn: The model performs very well in predicting non-churning customers, with high precision (0.85) and very high recall (0.99).
* Poor Performance for Churn: The model struggles significantly with predicting churning customers, with very low precision (0.44) and extremely low recall (0.04). This results in a very low F1-score (0.07) for the churn class.
* Imbalance Impact: The performance metrics indicate that the model is heavily biased towards the majority class (non-churning customers) and performs poorly on the minority class (churning customers).
* Account Length: The duration of the customer's account in days.
* Area Code: The area code of the customer's phone number.
* International Plan: Whether the customer has an international calling plan.
* Voice Mail Plan: Whether the customer has a voice mail feature.
* Number Vmail Messages: The number of voice mail messages.
* Total Day Minutes, Calls, Charge: Daytime call details.
* Total Eve Minutes, Calls, Charge: Evening call details.
* Total Night Minutes, Calls, Charge: Nighttime call details.
* Total Intl Minutes, Calls, Charge: International call details.
* Customer Service Calls: The number of calls made to customer service.
* Churn: The target variable indicating whether the customer churned.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of Churn
![]("C:\Users\amutu\OneDrive\Desktop\Moringa\Dsc-Phase-3-Project\output.png")
The dataset shows an imbalance in the target variable, with fewer customers churning compared to those who do not.
### Univariate Analysis
![Distribution of Numerical Features]("C:\Users\amutu\OneDrive\Desktop\Moringa\Dsc-Phase-3-Project\output.png")
Visualizations such as histograms and box plots were used to analyze the distribution and summary statistics of numeric features.
### Bivariate Analysis
Pairplots and cross-tabulations helped in understanding relationships between features and the target variable.
### MultiVariate Analysis
Correlation heatmap to show correlation between certain features in our data set
### Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: There were no missing values in the dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the data.
### Model Building
Three models were built and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: A simple, interpretable baseline model.
Random Forest: A more complex model with better performance.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Another complex model with different assumptions.
Hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest: The Random Forest model with optimized hyperparameters for improved performance.
### Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using ROC AUC and F1 scores:

* Logistic Regression: ROC AUC - 0.86, F1 Score - 0.79
* Random Forest: ROC AUC - 0.92, F1 Score - 0.85
* KNN: ROC AUC - 0.85, F1 Score - 0.77
* Hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest: ROC AUC - 0.94, F1 Score - 0.87
The Hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance with the highest ROC AUC and F1 scores.
### Evaluation
#### From this Logistic Regression model, we can deduce;
* Imbalanced Dataset: The dataset is imbalanced, with 566 non-churning and 101 churning customers. This imbalance affects the performance metrics, particularly for the minority class (churning customers).
* High Precision but Low Recall for Churn: The model has a reasonable precision for predicting churn (58%), meaning that when it predicts churn, it is correct more than half the time. However, it struggles with recall (21%), meaning it misses a significant number of actual churning customers.
* Strong Performance for Non-Churn: The model performs very well for non-churning customers, with high precision (87%) and recall (97%), indicating it is very reliable in identifying customers who will not churn.
* Weighted Metrics: The weighted averages suggest the model has good overall performance, but the poor recall for churn indicates a need for improvement if predicting churn accurately is critical
#### From this Random forest Classification model, we can deduce:
* The ROC AUC score of 0.92 indicates a very good ability to distinguish between churning and non-churning customers.
* Improved Performance: The Random Forest model shows significantly improved performance over the logistic regression model, particularly in precision and F1-score for the True (churning) class.
* High Precision for Churn: The precision for the True class is perfect (1.00), meaning there are no false positives. Every customer predicted to churn actually churns.
* Balanced Recall: While the recall for the True class (0.60) is not perfect, it is much better than in the logistic regression model, indicating the Random Forest model is better at identifying actual churners.
* Overall Strong Metrics: The high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores, along with the ROC AUC score, indicate that the Random Forest model performs very well across all key metrics.
#### For this Tuned Random Forest Model, we can deduce that:
* The ROC AUC score of 0.92 indicates a very good ability to differentiate between churning and non-churning customers.
* High Precision and Recall for Non-Churn: The model performs exceptionally well in predicting non-churning customers, with very high precision (0.94) and recall (0.99).
* Improved Performance for Churn: The precision for predicting churn is very high (0.93), meaning the model makes very few false positive errors. However, the recall (0.63) is still somewhat limited, indicating that some churning customers are not being identified.
* Balanced Metrics: The F1-scores and weighted averages suggest the model has a good balance of precision and recall for both classes, indicating robust overall performance.
####For this KNN model, we can deduce that:
* High Recall for Non-Churn: The model performs very well in predicting non-churning customers, with high precision (0.85) and very high recall (0.99).
* Poor Performance for Churn: The model struggles significantly with predicting churning customers, with very low precision (0.44) and extremely low recall (0.04). This results in a very low F1-score (0.07) for the churn class.
* Imbalance Impact: The performance metrics indicate that the model is heavily biased towards the majority class (non-churning customers) and performs poorly on the minority class (churning customers).
* Low ROC AUC: The ROC AUC score of 0.69 shows the model's limited effectiveness in distinguishing between churners and non-churners.
### Recommendations
Deploy the Hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest model for real-time churn prediction to identify high-risk customers.
Implement targeted retention strategies based on model insights, such as offering special deals or personalized support to customers likely to churn.
Monitor model performance and update it regularly with new data to maintain accuracy and effectiveness.
### Conclusion
The Hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest model effectively predicts customer churn with high accuracy. By leveraging this model, SyriaTel can proactively address churn and improve customer retention, leading to reduced financial losses and increased customer satisfaction.
